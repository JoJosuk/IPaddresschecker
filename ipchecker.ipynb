    "## Python Program to Validate IP Addresses and Correct Incorrect IPs\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python program reads a list of IP addresses from a text file named `ipaddress.txt`, validates them to check if they are correct IP addresses, and then writes the correct IP addresses to the same file. If there are any incorrect IP addresses, the program asks the user to enter the website for that IP address, corrects the IP address and writes it to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The program performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It imports the `socket` module to work with IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defines a function `isvalid(ip)` that takes an IP address as input and checks if it is a valid IP address. The `socket.inet_aton()` function is used to validate the IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creates a list `avoidstrings` that contains some strings which should not be written to the output file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initializes two empty lists `correctips` and `incorrectips`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opens the input file `ipaddress.txt` and reads each IP address. If the IP address is in the `avoidstrings` list, it is skipped. If the IP address is valid, it is added to the `correctips` list, otherwise, it is added to the `incorrectips` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writes the correct IP addresses to the file `ipaddress.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each incorrect IP address, the program prompts the user to enter the website for that IP address. It corrects the IP address using `socket.gethostbyname()` function, writes the corrected IP address to the file `ipaddress.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program helps in validating IP addresses and correcting the incorrect ones.\n"
